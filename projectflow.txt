1. Create a git repo and clone it in local.
2. Create code.py and add code to it. (it will save a csv file to new "data" folder)
3. Do a git add-commit-push before initializing dvc.
4. Now do "dvc init" (creates .dvcignore, .dvc)
5. Make directory to store versions of dvc "mkdir S3" (creates a new S3 directory)
6. Now do "dvc remote add -d myremote S3" (to tell the directory where data versions will be stored) 
7. Next "dvc add data/"
    Now it will ask to do: ("git rm -r --cached 'data'" and "git commit -m "stop tracking data"")
    Because initially we were tracking data/ folder from git so now we remove it for DVC to handle.
